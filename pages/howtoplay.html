      <h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>
      <p>
        In its simplest form, Mafia is played by two teams: the <strong>mafia</strong> and
        the <em>town</em>. Live games require a moderator who does not participate as a
        player, and identities are assigned by handing out cards. In this version
        the moderator is automated and identities are electronically assigned at random.
        At the start of the game, every <strong>mafia</strong> member is given the identities of their teammates,
        whereas the innocents in the <em>town</em> only receive the number of <strong>mafia</strong> in the game, and do
        not know which players are members of the <strong>mafia</strong> and which are members of the <em>town</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two phases: night and day. At night, players with certain roles secretly perform
        special actions; during day, players discuss and vote to eliminate one player.
        These phases alternate with each other until all members of the <strong>mafia</strong> have been eliminated,
        a victory for the <em>town</em>, or the number of <strong>mafia</strong> is equal to
        the innocents in the <em>town</em>, a victory for the <strong>mafia</strong>.
